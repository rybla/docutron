After making your changes, run the command `just validate` to run automated code validation checks. Wait patiently for the script to run, until the output says that a validation step failed, or the output says "Validation completed successfully." You must address ALL diagnostics emitted from these validation checks, if any.

If all checks pass and the output says "Validation completed successfully.", then the script will begin prompting you to describe your changes. Follow the instructions.
